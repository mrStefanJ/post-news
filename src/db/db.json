      "description": "Keanu Reeves among 200 people at studio party where guests came as extras, says reports",
      "title": "Matrix party ‘disguised as film shoot’ to bypass German Covid rules",
      "text": "German health authorities say they plan to speak to the studio where the latest Matrix film was shot after a party allegedly attended by the Hollywood actor Keanu Reeves was held to mark the end of filming, despite coronavirus restrictions.\n About 200 people were at the party disguised as a film shoot, with the guests invited to come as extras in an apparent attempt to bypass health regulations, according to the German tabloid Bild.\nParties of up to 50 people are allowed in Berlin and the neighbouring state of Brandenburg, where the party reportedly took place at the Babelsberg film studios, west of the German capital. But they have to be registered in advance along with the submission of a so-called “hygiene concept” that has to be approved by authorities. Guests have to abide by physical distancing rules, and to wear a mask when not eating and drinking.",

      "text": "When he left the stage of the Wells Fargo Center in Philadelphia on 20 September 2016 – the last night of the Rock or Bust tour – he might have been running through that routine for the last time in the band’s then 43-year history. The final 23 shows had been completed with Axl Rose as singer (brilliantly, it must be said), after hearing problems had forced Brian Johnson to retire from the road; he could no longer find his pitch onstage, and every show made his hearing worse. That summer, their bassist Cliff Williams had said he, too, would be leaving the band.",

      "text": "VGreatness may beckon for Lewis Hamilton at this weekend’s Turkish Grand Prix but the world champion bears the weight well. Victory at Istanbul Park would ensure Hamilton becomes Formula One’s most successful driver in securing his seventh world championship to match the record set by Michael Schumacher. \nWhen considering the journey that brought him here the British driver had cause to reflect on the lessons learned since his first title and why he believes his greatest triumph will not come on track but in trying to make a difference on a broader stage than that which he has strode with such authority for 14 years.",
